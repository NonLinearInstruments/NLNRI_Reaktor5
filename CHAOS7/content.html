			      The Rossler system is the work of Otto Rossler a German biochemist. It is a model of chemical reaction and is considered one of the more notable strange attractors and often cited as an example of deterministic chaos. The system is represented by 3 coupled non-linear differential equations.<br>
			<br>
			      dx / dt = - y - z<br>
			<br>
			      dy / dt = x + a y<br>
			<br>
			      dz / dt = b + z ( x - c )<br>
			<br>
			      where a = 0.2, b = 0.2, c = 5.7<br>
			<br>
			      That being said, this ensemble lives up to the name. I would guess that this is more of a mathematical practice for the author than an attempt to make an enduring musical tool. The ROSSLER component written in core is beautifully laid out, looking more like a circuit than the average Reaktor component. Core programmers will likely find inspiration in it as a mathematical Rosetta stone.<br>

			      As far as the sound, its about what you would expect with the phrases &#146;strange attractor&#146; and &#145;deterministic chaos&#146; in its history. I was able to make some interesting WWII propeller plane noises with it, the presets mostly make clicking and popping noises. I think it&#146;d be more useful as the source of CC data for other instruments or effects than its own audio data. But who&#146;s to say Thom Yorke won&#146;t come along and use it on his next album and be heralded as a genius.<br>

			      Summary<br>
			<br>
			      Straight from the chalkboard and into your ears. It&#146;s math you can hear.<br>
			<br>
			      Sounds like:<br>
			<br>
			      Math, no bleeps or bloops, lots of pops and grumbly noises<br>
			      .<br>
			      Verdict:<br>
			<br>
			      Are you going to let Thom Yorke get all the acclaim? Well, are you? Also: Mathematical Rosetta stone for core programmers<br>

			      Thank you Nathan for your kind comments. I appreciate very much that you found it beatifully laid out, cause, you are right: this is a mathematical practice... but I do not resign to find a real musical application for this. Thanks for the nice comparison to the Rosetta stone, but if anyone wanting to explore it for musical purpouses needs any more clues, I check often n.i. user forum, so please post there (and if someone can help me to understand core a bit more, please attend this : http://www.native-instruments.com/forum_us/showthread.php?t 45425 )<br>
			<br>
			      By the way, I am sorry I do not know who Tom Yorke is ...<br>
